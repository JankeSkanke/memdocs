# Optional features in Configuration Manager

*Applies to: Configuration Manager (current branch)*

When an update includes one or more optional features, you can enable those features in your hierarchy. Enable features when the update installs, or return to the console later to enable the optional features.

To view available features and their status, in the console go to the **Administration** workspace, expand **Updates and Servicing**, and select the **Features** node. To enable a feature, select it in the list, and then select **Turn on** in the ribbon.

Your user account requires permissions to view and enable optional features. For more information, see [Permissions for in-console updates](prepare-in-console-updates.md#permissions).

When a feature isn't optional, it's automatically available for use. It doesn't appear in the **Features** node.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In a multi-site hierarchy, enable optional or pre-release features only from the central administration site (CAS). This behavior makes sure there are no conflicts across the hierarchy.<!--507197-->

When you enable a new feature or pre-release feature, the Configuration Manager hierarchy manager (HMAN) must process the change before that feature becomes available. Processing of the change is often immediate. Depending on the HMAN processing cycle, it can take up to 30 minutes to complete. After the change is processed, restart the console before you can use the feature.

When new cloud-based features are available in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, or other attached cloud services for your on-premises Configuration Manager installation, you can opt in to these new features in the Configuration Manager console.<!--5834830-->
