# Microsoft Deployment Toolkit known issues

This article provides details of any current known issues and limitations with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT). It assumes familiarity with MDT version concepts, features, and capabilities.

## ZTI extensions with version 2013 or 2107

<!-- 10695200 -->

If you install a new Configuration Manager site with version 2103 or 2107, when you run the MDT **Configure ConfigMgr Integration Wizard**, the MDT extensions aren't added to the site.

To work around this issue, disable the hierarchy setting for approved console extensions. For more information, see [Enable or disable hierarchy approved console extensions](../core/servers/manage/admin-console-extensions.md#enable-hierarchy-approved-console-extensions).

## Windows 10, version 2004

When you use MDT build 8456 with the Windows ADK for Windows 10, version 2004, the BIOS firmware type is incorrectly identified as UEFI. This issue results in failures when refreshing an existing computer with a new version of Windows. To mitigate this issue, install the [MDT hotfix 4564442](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4564442).

## Modern language pack support

Starting with Windows 10 version 1809, language interface packs (LIPs) are delivered as local experience packs (LXPs). LXPs are AppX bundles. When specified in the unattend.xml file, they aren't automatically selected, and the deployment fails. Don't set LXPs as default. Users should select an applied LXP from Windows settings.

## Security risk when run over the network

<!-- 2835722 -->

Binaries or scripts that run over the network aren't verified against a digital signature. This issue increases the risk of an attacker tampering with the binaries and injecting malicious code.

To mitigate this issue, protect the network connection with IPsec or SMB signing.
