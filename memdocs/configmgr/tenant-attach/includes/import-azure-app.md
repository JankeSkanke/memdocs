## <a name="bkmk_aad_app"></a> Import a previously created Azure AD application (optional)
<!--6479246-->

During a new onboarding, an administrator can specify a previously created application during onboarding to tenant attach. Don't share or reuse Azure AD applications across multiple hierarchies. If you have multiple hierarchies, create separate Azure AD applications for each.

From the onboarding page in the **Cloud Attach Configuration Wizard** (**Co-management Configuration Wizard** in versions 2103 and earlier), select **Optionally import a separate web app to synchronize Configuration Manager client data to Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**. This option will prompt you to specify the following information for your Azure AD app:

- Azure AD tenant name
- Azure AD tenant ID
- Application name
- Client ID
- Secret key
- Secret key expiry
- App ID URI

> [!Important]
> When you use an imported Azure AD app, you aren't notified of an upcoming expiration date from [console notifications](../../core/servers/manage/admin-console-notifications.md). <!--10568158--> 

### Azure AD application permissions and configuration

Using a previously created application during onboarding to tenant attach requires the following permissions:

- Configuration Manager Microservice permissions:
   - CmCollectionData.read
   - CmCollectionData.write

- Microsoft Graph permissions:
   - Directory.Read.All [Applications permission](/graph/permissions-reference#application-permissions)
   - Directory.Read.All [Delegated directory permission](/graph/permissions-reference#directory-permissions)

- Ensure **Grant admin consent for Tenant** is selected for the Azure AD application. For more information, see [Grant admin consent in App registrations](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent).

- The imported application needs to be configured as follows:
   - Registered for **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. For more information, see [Change who can access your application](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-modify-supported-accounts#to-change-who-can-access-your-application).
   -  Has a valid application ID URI and secret
