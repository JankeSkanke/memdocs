## <a name="bkmk_exclusion"></a> Antivirus policy exclusions merge
<!--9089764 -->
*(Introduced in 2103)*

Starting in Configuration Manager 2103, When a tenant attached device is targeted with two or more antivirus policies, the settings for antivirus exclusions will merge before being applied to the client. This change results in the client receiving the exclusions defined in each policy, allowing for more granular control of antivirus exclusions. For earlier versions of Configuration Manager, Antivirus exclusions from a single policy are applied. With this behavior, the last policy applied determines the effective exclusions. <!--9397015-->

To use this functionality, create an antivirus policy from the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/) that includes some [antivirus exclusions](../../intune/protect/antivirus-microsoft-defender-settings-windows-tenant-attach.md?toc=/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/toc.json&bc=/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/breadcrumb/toc.json#microsoft-defender-antivirus-exclusions). Create a second antivirus policy including only antivirus exclusions that are different from the first policy. Apply both antivirus policies to the same collection. Antivirus exclusions from both policies are applied on clients in the targeted collection.
