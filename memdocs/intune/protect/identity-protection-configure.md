# Use Windows Hello for Business on Windows devices with Microsoft Intune

Windows Hello for Business is a method for signing in to Windows devices by replacing passwords, smart cards, and virtual smart cards. Intune includes built-in settings so Administrators can configure and use Windows Hello for Business. For example, you can use these settings to:

- Enable Windows Hello for Business for devices and users
- Set device PIN requirements, including a minimum or maximum PIN length
- Allow gestures, such as a fingerprint, that users can (or can't use) to sign in to devices

This feature applies to devices running:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

> [!NOTE]
> For customers looking to configure Windows Holographic for Business, please use [DeviceLock CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-devicelock)

Intune uses *configuration profiles* to create and customize these settings for your organization's needs. After you add these features in a profile, push or deploy these settings to user and device groups in your organization.

This article shows you how to create a device configuration profile. For a list of all the settings, and what they do, see [Windows device settings to enable Windows Hello for Business](identity-protection-windows-settings.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to how Intune determines the scope and applicability of Windows Hello for Business policy, the device may log **Event ID 454** as a result of applying policy. This can be safely ignored when policy is being successful applied (and enforced).

## Create the device profile

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

2. Select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.

3. Enter the following properties:

   - **Platform**: Select **Windows 10 and later**.
   - **Profile**: Select **Templates** > **Identity protection**.

4. Select **Create**.

5. In **Basics**, enter the following properties:

   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the new profile. Name your policies so you can easily identify them later.
   - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. This setting is optional, but recommended.

   Select **Next** to continue.

6. In **Configuration settings**, configure the following settings:

   - **Configure Windows Hello for Business**: Choose how you want to configure Windows Hello for Business:

     - **Not configured** (default): [Provisions Windows Hello for Business](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-how-it-works-provisioning) on the device. When assigning identity protection profiles to users only, the device context defaults to **Not configured**.

     - **Disabled**: If you don't want to use Windows Hello for Business, select this option. This option disables Windows Hello for Business for all users.

     - **Enabled**: Choose this option to [provision](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-how-it-works-provisioning), and configure Windows Hello for Business settings in Intune. Enter the settings you want to configure. For a list of all settings, and what they do, see - [Windows device settings to enable Windows Hello for Business](identity-protection-windows-settings.md).

   - **Use security keys for sign-in**: Enable Windows Hello security key as a logon credential for all PCs in the tenant.

     - **Enable**
     - **Not configured**  (default)

   Select **Next** to continue.

7. In **Assignments**, select the user and device groups that will receive this profile. For more information on assigning profiles, see [Assign user and device profiles](../configuration/device-profile-assign.md).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > To allow multiple users to be provisioned to a device, specify that the Windows Hello for Business policy be applied to the devices. If the policy is applied only to users, only one user can be provisioned to a device.

   Select **Next**.

8. In **Applicability Rules**, use the **Rule**, **Property**, and **Value** options to define how this profile applies within assigned groups. Intune applies the profile to devices that meet the rules you enter. For more information about applicability rules, see [Applicability rules](../configuration/device-profile-create.md).

   Select Next.

9. In **Review + create**, review your settings. When you select **Create**, your changes are saved, and the profile is assigned. The policy is also shown in the profiles list.
