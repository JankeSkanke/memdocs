# Custom compliance JSON files

To support [custom settings for compliance](../protect/compliance-use-custom-settings.md), you create a JSON file that identifies the settings and value pairs that you want to use for custom compliance. The JSON defines what a PowerShell discovery script will evaluate for compliance on the device.

You’ll upload the JSON file when you create a compliance policy that includes custom compliance settings. 

A correctly formatted JSON file must include the following information:

- **SettingName** - The name of the custom setting to use for base compliance.
- **Operator** - Represents a specific action that is used to build a compliance rule. For options, see the following list of supported operators.
- **DataType** - The type of data that you can use to build your compliance rule. For options, see the following list of supported DataTypes.
- **Operand** - Represent the values that the operator works on.
- **MoreInfoURL** - A URL that’s shown to device users so they can learn more about the compliance requirement when their device is noncompliant for a setting. You can also use this to link to instructions to help users bring their device into compliance for this setting.
- **RemediationStrings** - Information that gets displayed in the Company Portal when a device is noncompliant to a setting. This information is intended to help users understand the remediation options to bring a device to a compliant state.

**Supported operators**:  
- IsEquals
- NotEquals
- GreaterThan
- GreaterEquals
- LessThan
- LessEquals

**Supported DataTypes**:  
- Boolean
- Int64
- Double
- String
- DateTime
- Version

**Supported Languages**:  
- cs_CZ
- da_DK
- de_DE
- el_GR

## Example JSON file
