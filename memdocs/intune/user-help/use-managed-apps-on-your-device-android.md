# Work or school apps for Android  
Intune-managed apps (*managed* apps for short) are apps that've been configured for you to securely use at work or school. They're specially-configured to meet your organization's security requirements and protect internal data. For example, if you're signed in to one of these apps with your work or school account, your org can restrict certain features, such as copy and paste. Or they could restrict you from saving work files to your device's local storage. These types of restrictions prevent proprietary information from being shared outside of the app or org. 

To maximize data protection, your organization might configure several of these apps to work together. For example:  
1. You connect to your organization's network in a managed browser app, such as Microsoft Edge.  
2. You click a link to open a peer's presentation file.  
3. An appropriate managed app, such as Microsoft PowerPoint, opens the file.  

Your org can require you to use a specific app to do something like opening a work file, or accessing a web link. If you don't have the app, you might not be able to do these things.  

## How do I know I'm using a managed app?
When you sign in or try to access work or school data in a managed app, you'll receive an on-screen message that the app is protected by your organization. 

## Common managed apps  
Examples of commonly required or available managed apps in schools and workplaces are:

- Microsoft Edge

- Microsoft Outlook

- Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint

## How do I get work or school apps?
There are three ways to get these apps:   
* Your organization automatically installs apps to your device at time of enrollment.  
* You install an app from the Google Play store, and then sign in to the app with your work or school account.    
* Your organization makes managed apps available to you in Company Portal. Go to the Company Portal app or website to search, view, and install available apps. For more information about these apps, see the next section, [Available apps](#available-apps).  

### Available apps   
 Your organization can select apps that are appropriate and useful for you at work or school, and make them available to you in Company Portal.  

 Apps are also made available to you based on your device type. For example, if you're using the Company Portal app for Android, you'll have access to Android apps, but not iOS apps.   

## Request an app for work or school   
 If there's an app you need, but don't see in Company Portal, you can request it. You'll find contact details for your IT support person in the Company Portal **Contact IT** tab. The same contact information is available on the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).   

## What can my org manage in an app?  
The following list describes the settings your IT support person can control within an app. These settings affect how you view, access, and otherwise use work or school data on your device:

* Access to specific websites  

* Access to internal company websites using Microsoft Edge and the Azure Active Directory proxy  

* Minimum version of app, version of OS

* Ability to share and transfer data between apps  

* How and where you save files  

* Copy and paste functionality  

* PIN access requirements  

* How you sign in, using company credentials  

* Ability to back up data to the cloud  

* Ability to take screenshots  

* Data encryption requirements  

## Next step  

* Contact your IT support person for more information about the managed apps on your device. For contact information, check the [Company Portal website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2010980).

* For information about using work or school apps on an iOS device, see [Get work or school apps for iOS](use-managed-apps-on-your-device-ios.md).
