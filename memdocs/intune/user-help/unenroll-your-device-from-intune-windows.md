## Removing your personal information after removing the Company Portal  

There are two kinds of data that the Company Portal stores on your Windows device:

- **Application cache**: Support files that are required for the app to work, such as icons and settings.

To delete the stored logs and cache, complete one of the following steps:

* [Uninstall the Company Portal app](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028003/windows-10-uninstall-apps-and-programs) 

* Reset the Company Portal app. Open the **Settings** app and select > **Apps** > **Company Portal** > **Advanced options** > **Reset**.
