**Applies to**  
- Windows 10  
- Windows 11  

Whenever an an error or event occurs on your device, the details of such events are recorded and saved to a document called a _diagnostic log_. Diagnostic logs can provide your support team with enough information to diagnose and fix problems on your device.  

1. Open the **Settings** app on your device.  
2. Go to **Accounts** > **Access work or school**.  
3. Select **Export your management log files**.  

   ![The "Access work or school screen", which presents the Export option underneath the "Related settings" heading.](./media/w10-export-logs.png)

4. Email the logs to your support person. Logs are saved in **C:\Users\Public\Public Documents\MDMDiagnostics**. Two files are created for each log: one is the log itself, and the other is a document that allows your admin to review the logs in different programs, such as Microsoft Excel. Include both files in your email to your support person. 

You can also [send Company Portal app logs](send-logs-to-your-it-admin-cp-windows.md) to your support person.
