Get the latest version of the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app on your Android, iOS, macOS, or Windows device. We recommend using the latest version of the Company Portal app on your device because it contains the latest bug fixes and security updates.

If an update is required, you'll receive a notification from Company Portal.

Google Play Store will notify you when a new version of the Company Portal is available. You won't see a prompt in the Company Portal app itself. Select the Google Play alert and follow the onscreen prompts to update the app.

When a new version of Company Portal becomes available, you'll see an **Update** option in the App Store. 

1. Open the App Store and search for **Intune**.  
2. Look for the **Update** option next to the Intune Company Portal listing. If available, tap **Update**. 
3. Follow the onscreen prompts to install the update.

5. Select the device that you're currently using.
6. Select **Check Status** to sync your changes.
