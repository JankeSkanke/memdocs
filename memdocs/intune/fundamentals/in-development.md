<!-- ***********************************************-->

## App management

### Device compliance status in Company Portal website<!-- 8782968 -->
End users will be able to more easily see the compliance status of their devices from the Company Portal website. End users can navigate to the [Company Portal](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com/devices) website and select the **Devices** page to see device status. Devices will be listed with a status of **Can access company resources**, **Checking access**, or **Can't access company resources**. For related information, see [Manage apps from the Company Portal website](../user-help/manage-apps-cpweb.md) and [How to configure the Intune Company Portal apps, Company Portal website, and Intune app](../apps/company-portal-app.md).

### Password complexity for Android devices<!-- 9321870 -->
The **Require device lock** setting in Intune will be extended to include values (**Low Complexity**, **Medium Complexity**, and **High Complexity**). If the device lock doesn’t meet the minimum password requirement, you will be able to **warn**, **wipe data**, or **block** the end user from accessing a managed account in a managed app. This feature targets devices that operate on Android 11+. For devices operating on Android 10 and earlier, setting a complexity value of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** will default to the expected behavior for **Low Complexity**. For related information, see [Android app protection policy settings in Microsoft Intune](..\apps\app-protection-policy-settings-android.md).

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## Device security

### BlackBerry Cylance – New Mobile Threat Defense partner<!-- 7822722  IDready -->
You’ll soon be able to use [BlackBerry’s Cylance AI](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/unified-endpoint-security/cylance-ai) offering as an integrated Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) partner with Intune to control mobile device access to corporate resources using Conditional Access based on risk assessment.

<!-- ***********************************************-->

## Device configuration

### New option to see the number of profiles with an error or conflict in device configuration profiles<!-- 9142810 -->
In the Endpoint Manager admin center, there's a new option that states something like "X policies with error or conflict". When you select this option, you automatically go to the **Devices** > **Monitor** > **Assignment Failures** report. This report helps you troubleshoot errors and conflicts.

This new option is available in the following locations in the Endpoint Manager admin center:
- Home page
- Dashboard
- **Devices** > **Configuration profiles**: When you select a Windows profile, the **Overview** summary page shows this option.

For more information, see [Monitor device profiles in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/device-profile-monitor.md) and [Assignment failures report](reports.md#assignment-failures-report-operational).

Applies to:
- Windows 10 and newer

### New Timeout and Block iCloud Private Relay settings for iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices<!-- 10370284 -->
On iOS/iPadOS and macOS devices, you can create a device restrictions policy that manages features on the device (**Devices** > **Configuration Profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform > **Device restrictions**).

There are new settings:
- iOS/iPadOS:
  - **Block iCloud Private Relay**: On supervised devices, this setting prevents users from using the [iCloud Private Relay](https://support.apple.com/HT212614) (opens Apple's web site).
- macOS:
  - **Block iCloud Private Relay**: On supervised devices, this setting prevents users from using the [iCloud Private Relay](https://support.apple.com/HT212614) (opens Apple's web site).
  - **Timeout**: Users can unlock their devices using a Touch ID, such as a fingerprint. Use this setting to require users to enter their password after a period of inactivity. The default inactivity period is is 48 hours. After 48 hours of inactivity, the device prompts for the password, instead of Touch ID.

Applies to:
- iOS/iPadOS 15 and newer
- macOS 12 and newer

### New device restrictions settings for Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices with a work profile<!-- 10982232 -->
On Android Enterprise devices, you can configure settings that control features on devices (**Devices** > **Configuration Profiles** > **Create profile** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile type).

For Android Enterprise corporate-owned devices with a work profile, there are new settings:
- Restrict searching work contacts and displaying work contact caller-ID in personal profile
- Restrict copy and paste between work and personal profiles
- Restrict data sharing between work and personal profiles

For more information on the settings you can currently configure, see [Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md).

Applies to:
- Android Enterprise corporate-owned work profile (COPE)

### Settings Catalog will soon be supported on U.S. Government GCC High and DoD<!-- 12389409 -->
Settings Catalog will soon be available and supported on U.S. Government GCC High and DoD.

For more information on Settings Catalog, and what it is, see [Use the settings catalog to configure settings on Windows and macOS devices](../configuration/settings-catalog.md).

Applies to:
- macOS
- Windows 10 and newer

### Enter the certificate common name in Wi-Fi profiles for Android Enterprise fully managed, dedicated, and corporate-owned work profile devices<!-- 12439458  -->
On Android Enterprise devices, you can create a Wi-Fi profile that configures enterprise Wi-Fi settings (**Devices** > **Configuration Profiles** > **Create profile** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile** > **Wi-Fi** for profile type).

When you select **Enterprise**, there's a new **Server names** setting. This setting is the DNS name used in the certificate presented by the Radius Server during client authentication to the Wi-Fi access point. For example, enter `Contoso.com`, `uk.contoso.com`, or `jp.contoso.com`.

If you have multiple Radius servers with the same DNS suffix in their fully qualified domain name, then you can enter only the suffix. For example, you can enter `contoso.com`.

When you enter this value, user devices can bypass the dynamic trust dialog that's sometimes shown when connecting to the Wi-Fi network. 

**What you need to know**:
- New Wi-Fi profiles targeting Android 11 or later may require this setting to be configured. Otherwise, the devices may not connect to your Wi-Fi network.

For more information on the settings you can currently configure, see [Android Enterprise Fully Managed, Dedicated, and Corporate-Owned Work Profile Wi-Fi settings](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-android-enterprise.md#fully-managed-dedicated-and-corporate-owned-work-profile).

Applies to:
- Android Enterprise corporate-owned work profile (COPE)
- Android Enterprise corporate owned fully managed (COBO)
- Android Enterprise dedicated devices (COSU)

### New Administrative Templates settings for Microsoft Edge 96 and Microsoft Edge updater on Windows devices<!-- 12442597 -->
In Intune, you can use Administrative Templates to configure Microsoft Edge settings (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **Templates** > **Administrative Templates** for profile type).

There are new Administrative Templates settings for Microsoft Edge 96 and the Microsoft  Edge updater, including **Target Channel override** support. Use **Target Channel override** so users get the **Extended Stable** release cycle option, which can be set using Group Policy or through Intune.

For related information, see:
- [Configure Microsoft Edge policy settings in Microsoft Intune](../configuration/administrative-templates-configure-edge.md)
- [Overview of the Microsoft Edge channels](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-channels)
- [Microsoft Edge Browser Policy Documentation](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies)

Applies to:
- Windows 10 and newer
- Microsoft Edge

### Use filters to assign Endpoint analytics proactive remediations scripts and Endpoint Security policies in Endpoint Manager admin center - public preview<!-- 7566953 7591178  -->

In the Endpoint Manager admin center, you can create filters, and then use these filters when assigning apps and policies. You'll be able to use filters to assign the following policies:

- [Endpoint analytics proactive remediations Windows PowerShell scripts](../../analytics/proactive-remediations.md) (**Reports** > **Endpoint analytics** > **Proactive remediations**)
- [Endpoint Security policies](../protect/endpoint-security-policy.md), including Account protection, Antivirus, Attack surface reduction, and more.

For more information on filters, see [Use filters (preview) when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles](filters.md).

Applies to:

- macOS
- Windows 10 and newer

<!-- ***********************************************-->
## Device enrollment

### Use filters on Windows Enrollment Status Page profile assignments<!-- 7423484  -->

Filters allows you to include or exclude devices in policy or app assignments based on different device properties. When you create an Enrollment Status Page (ESP) profile, you'll be able to use filters when assigning the profile. The **All users** and **All devices** assignment options will also be available. You will be able to find this setting in [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Devices** > **Enroll devices** > **Enrollment Status Page** > **Create**. For more information about filters, see [Use filters when assigning your apps, policies, and profiles](../fundamentals/filters.md). For more information about ESP profiles, see [Set up the Enrollment Status Page](../enrollment/windows-enrollment-status.md).

### Use filters on device type enrollment restrictions for Windows and Apple enrollments<!-- 9284419 -->
New assignment filters in Enrollment Restrictions will let you include or exclude restrictions based on device type. For example, you can allow personal devices, while blocking Windows 10 Home devices, by applying the operatingSystemSKU assignment filter. These filters will be released for public preview with a new configuration experience for enrollment restrictions and supported for Windows and Apple devices, with Android support coming at a later date. For more information about how to use filters, see [Create a filter](../fundamentals/filters.md).   

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
## Monitor and troubleshoot  

### Account protection policy changes in Endpoint security<!--  7492116   -->

We’re reworking the endpoint security Account protection policy to use the new APIs for Windows Hello for Business. The new APIs will result in a more consistent experience. The new API is *./Device/Vendor/MSFT/PassportForWork*, which includes more options that can help reduce conflicts.   This API replaces the use of  *./User/Vendor/MSFT/PassportForWork*.  (**Endpoint security** > **Account protection**)

After the change, only new policies you then create will use the new API. Your existing policies won’t be affected by this change and will continue to use the older API.

### Intune Data Warehouse updates<!-- 9370034 -->

The  `applicationInventory`  entity will be removed from the Intune Data Warehouse in an upcoming Intune service release. We're introducing a more complete and accurate dataset that will be available in the UI and via our export API. For related information, see [Export Intune reports using Graph APIs](../fundamentals/reports-export-graph-apis.md).
