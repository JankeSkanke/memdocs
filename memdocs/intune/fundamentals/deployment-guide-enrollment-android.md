# Deployment guide: Enroll Android devices in Microsoft Intune

Personal and organization-owned devices can be enrolled in Intune. Once enrolled, they receive the policies and profiles you create. You have the following options when enrolling Android devices:

- [BYOD: Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile](#byod-android-enterprise-personally-owned-devices-with-a-work-profile)
- [Android Enterprise corporate owned dedicated devices](#android-enterprise-dedicated-devices) (COSU)
- [Android Enterprise corporate owned fully managed](#android-enterprise-fully-managed) (COBO)
- [Android Enterprise corporate owned work profile](#android-enterprise-corporate-owned-work-profile) (COPE)
- [Android device administrator](#android-device-administrator) (DA)

This article provides recommendations on the Android enrollment methods. It also includes an overview of the administrator and user tasks for each enrollment type.

For more specific information, see [Enroll Android devices](../enrollment/android-enroll.md).

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE [tips-guidance-plan-deploy-guides](../includes/tips-guidance-plan-deploy-guides.md)]

## Before you begin

For an overview, including any Intune-specific prerequisites, see [Deployment guidance: Enroll devices in Microsoft Intune](deployment-guide-enrollment.md).

## BYOD: Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile

These devices are personal or BYOD (bring your own device) Android devices that access organization email, apps, and other data.

---
| Feature | Use this enrollment option when |
| --- | --- | 
| Devices are personal or BYOD. | ✔️ <br/><br/> You can mark these devices as corporate or personal. |
| You have new or existing devices. | ✔️ |
| Need to enroll a small number of devices, or a large number of devices (bulk enrollment). | ✔️ |
| Devices are associated with a single user. | ✔️ |
| You use the optional device enrollment manager (DEM) account. | ✔️ |
| Devices are managed by another MDM provider. | ❌ <br/><br/> When a device enrolls, MDM providers install certificates and other files. These files must be removed. The quickest way may be to unenroll, or factory reset the devices. If you don't want to factory reset, then contact the MDM provider. |
| Devices are owned by the organization or school. | ❌ <br/><br/>Not recommended for organization-owned devices. Organization-owned devices should be enrolled using [Android Enterprise fully managed](#android-enterprise-fully-managed) (in this article), or using [Android Enterprise corporate owned work profile](#android-enterprise-corporate-owned-work-profile) (in this article). |
| Devices are user-less, such as kiosk, dedicated, or shared. | ❌ <br/><br/> User-less or shared devices should be organization-owned. These devices should be enrolled using Android Enterprise dedicated devices. |

1. Go to the Google Play store, and install the [Company Portal app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal).
2. Users open the Company Portal app, and sign in with their organization credentials (`user@contoso.com`). After they sign in, your enrollment profile applies to the device.

## Android device administrator

These Android devices are corporate, or personal/BYOD (bring your own device) devices that can access organization email, apps, and other data.

Google is reducing device administrator support in new Android releases. To avoid reduced functionality, Microsoft recommends:

- Enroll new devices using [Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile](#byod-android-enterprise-personally-owned-devices-with-a-work-profile) (in this article). Don't enroll new devices using Android device administrator.
- Create a device enrollment restriction to block device administrator enrollment. Android devices may try to enroll using device administrator before trying other enrollment methods. So, create the restriction to prevent this behavior. For more information, see [Set enrollment restrictions](../enrollment/enrollment-restrictions-set.md).
- If devices will update to Android 10, then migrate devices off device administrator management.
- Move existing Android device administrator devices to [Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile](#byod-android-enterprise-personally-owned-devices-with-a-work-profile) (in this article) or [corporate-owned work profiles](#android-enterprise-corporate-owned-work-profile) (in this article). For more information, see [Move Android devices from device administrator to work profile management](../enrollment/android-move-device-admin-work-profile.md).
- By default, device administrator enrollment is blocked on new tenants.

There are some situations when you must use Device Administrator enrollment:

- Android Enterprise requires access to Google services. Google services may not be available because of geography, or because of the device manufacturer. For example:

  - There are places where Google services are not available, like China. In this situation, use Android device administrator enrollment.  
  - Some devices are based on Android, but don't have access to Google Services, such as Amazon Fire tablets. In this situation, use Android device administrator enrollment.

- Android OS versions older than 5.0 must use Android device administrator enrollment. Android Enterprise enrollment isn't an option.
