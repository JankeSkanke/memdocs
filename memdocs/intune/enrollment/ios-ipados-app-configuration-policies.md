# iOS/iPadOS security configuration framework app configuration policies

As part of the [iOS/iPadOS security configuration framework](ios-ipados-configuration-framework.md), you must properly set app configuration policies for iOS/iPadOS devices.

iOS/iPadOS supervised devices are designed to be used for work or school data only. So, Microsoft apps deployed on these devices must be configured to disallow personal accounts.

## Disallow personal accounts for Microsoft apps on iOS/iPadOS devices

1. Add the iOS apps so that they can be deployed to the device. For more information, see [Add iOS store apps to Microsoft Intune]().
2. Create a policy for each Microsoft app as described in [Add app configuration policies for managed iOS/iPadOS devices]().
3. Create the following single key in each policy: 

    | Key | Values |
    | --- | --- |
    | IntuneMAMAllowedAccountsOnly | **Enabled**: The only account allowed is the managed user account defined by the IntuneMAMUPN key.<br>**Disabled** (or any value that is not a case insensitive match to **Enabled**): Any account is allowed. |
    | IntuneMAMUPN | UPN of the account allowed to sign into the app. For Intune enrolled devices, the {{userprincipalname}} token may be used to represent the enrolled user account. |

## Next steps
Apply [iOS/iPadOS device compliance security configuration settings](ios-ipados-device-compliance-security-configurations.md).
