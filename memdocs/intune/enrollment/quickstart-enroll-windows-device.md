# Quickstart: Enroll your Windows device  

**Applies to**
- Windows 10 
- Windows 11 

In this quickstart, you'll first take the role of an Intune user and enroll a device running Windows 10/11 into Microsoft Intune. Then you'll return to Intune and confirm that the device enrolled.  

Enrolling your devices into Microsoft Intune allows you to access your organization's secure data, including email, files, and other resources, from your Windows device. This is true for both devices running Windows 10/11 devices (including desktop) and Windows 10 Mobile devices. Enrolling your devices helps secure this access for both you and your organization, and helps keep your work data separate from your personal data.
